                    pipenv install pillow (see notes on library below)
                  
                 
When images are uploaded from the form they will all end up in the root project folder.
It will be an mess. to avoid this the code below needs to be added to the project settings.

    in this project its added below STATIC_URL = "static/"

    MEDIA_URL = "/media/"
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "media")
    import os

    os must be impoorted in project settings


    MEDIA_ROOT takes two arguments
        1. the first is the base directory which is predefined in the project settings.
        2. "media" this tells the operating system to join the base directory path of this 
            project with media url with a forward slash. 

    This all will create a midia folder in the project root folder for all the images to be stored.  

                    Model Update
        in models.py add the argument ~upload_to="pictures/%Y/%m/%d/"~ to the ImageField
        picture1 = models.ImageField(blank=True, null=True, upload_to="pictures/%Y/%m/%d/")

    This will create a new folder called (pictures) in the above created media folder.
    This pictures folder will contain a folder with the year, which will contain a folder
    with the month, which will contain a folder with the day. in this folder the image 
    will be stored on that day it was created.

    ~Pillow Library by  Alex Clark and Contributors~
The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities
to your Python interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient 
internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few 
basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image 
processing tool.
