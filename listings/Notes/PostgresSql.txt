    (PostgreSQL & PostGIS) works better with spacial data

    Spatial data - is any type of data that
    directly or indirectly references a specific
    geographical area or location. Sometimes called
    geospatial data or geographic information, spatial 
    data can also numerically represent a physical object in 
    a geographic coordinate system. However, spatial data is 
    much more than a spatial component of a map.
