When images are uploaded from the form they will all end up in the root project folder.
It will be an mess. to avoid this the code below needs to be added to the project settings.
 
    in this project its added below STATIC_URL = "static/"

    MEDIA_URL = "/media/"
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "media")
    import os

    os must be impoorted in project settings


    MEDIA_ROOT takes two arguments
        1. the first is the base directory which is predefined in the project settings.
        2. "media" this tells the operating system to join the base directory path of this 
            project with media url with a forward slash. 

    This all will create a midia folder in the project root folder for all the images to be stored.
